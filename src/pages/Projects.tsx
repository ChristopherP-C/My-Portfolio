When users run the application they recieve a series of prompts which they can answer to generate a README file, which is then placed in a seperate dist folder to be edited, copied, and used however they see fit.',

It also provides basic troubleshooting tips to try and aid new developers to find and fix common issues quickly.',
            detailedDescription: 'As my first collaborative project, FuncTastic certainly came with its share of learning curves. I learned a lot about working with others, and how to manage a project with multiple contributors. There are many more places I want to go with this project, and I dont see myself leaving it just yet. I believe there is plenty of potential for it to be a useful extension that can help many coders.',
