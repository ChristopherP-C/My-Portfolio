                        I intend to recieve my certificate of completion from the University of Minnesota bootcamp program.
                        I have been in the job force since the age of 14, and since then I have worked in various conditions requiring problem solving and quick thinking,
                        and have been able to move forward in those working environments. I have led a team as a service and kitchen manager, become a certified trainer,
                        and fixed various machines on an assebly floor. I maintained a 3.5 unwieghted GPA in high school, and participated in many extracurricular activities.
