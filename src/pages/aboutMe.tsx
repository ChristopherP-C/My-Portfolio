                        Ever since a young age I have been interested in technology. Growing up I had limited access to the internet, and so unfortunattely I was unable to truly explore coding to its fullest. However, I still
                        strove to make efforts to learn how I could, by picking up various small books about coding, and using a basic scratch program to learn and practice with, and when I reached highschool, I was finally able to really experience the
                        world of coding. While my school did not offer a class on coding, they did offer what was called a "self-directed study", a program in which a student could choose a subject, study it independently, and have a teacher proctor progress and assign criteria.
                        The particular teacher I chose was a man who had taught C++ previously at a college, and upon hearing my request, he immediatly offered me a copy of one of his old text books, and challenged me to remake a text based game called Hamurabi. The task
                        proved difficult, especially considering I did not have a dedicated computer, apart from an old Chrombook. My only method of compiling was a brwoser compiler, which meant bugs were tough to fix, and sometime the code itself would dissapear, meaening I would
                        have to start over. Despite these hurdles, I persevered, and created a version of Hamurabi I was proud of, and even started making my own seperate dungeon crawling text based experience. The experience was incredible, and talght me how much patience and dedication
                        coders need. It also taught me that I love coding. I worked hard and saved my money from my job at the time, and eventually built my own desktop, to try and continue pursuing learning. Over the next few years while I had been able to learn how to use certain engines
                        and practice C++, I unfortunately was unable to dedicate the time I could before, especially since I moved out and had lived on my own since my first summer out of highschool. I worked hard over the years to keep ahead of my expenses, and finally found myself in a
                        position where I could take the coding bootcamp offered at the University of Minnesota. My journey thus far has been amazing, and I am earger to see what I can do with the future.
