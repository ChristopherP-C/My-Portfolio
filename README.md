# My-Portfolio

  ## Description
    This is my personal portfolio
    I want it to display what I am capable of and how far I have come
    This has been my first real public work that I want people to visit
    Working on this taught me a lot about react, coding, and myself


  ## Credits
This portfolio was made using the react-dom and react-router-dom packages
Styling was made using Bootstrap
Vite was used in development
